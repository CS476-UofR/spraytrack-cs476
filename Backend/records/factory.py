""" 
This file will implement the factory design pattern.

IN our app we need to create two types of users which are: 
    -Operators 
    -Admin

And we need this to happen without the views knowing the details of how everything is 
put together.

Im basing most of this off of the pizza structure we talked about during lectures 

This will also contain the spray record factory for creating spray records with polygon validation and calculation of the center point of the polygon.
After creating objects they will fire events to notify the observers which hopefully connects these design patterns together in a nice way.

""" 
This file will implement the observer design pattern that we learned in our lectures 

To do this we need to make sure to notify all dependant objects and then update them accordingly. 
Changes in the state of one object are reported to these dependent objects. 

In our program, when a spray record's status changes, like from a draft to submitted, we need to 
automatically create an audit log entry without our view code knowing about this. 
By doing this the code is then decoupled and maintainable. 

We have to make sure we maintain conssitency between the related objects. So when a status is changed, the log must be updated 
We have to make sure the dependent objects are up to date with this state change. 

Ill try to highlight a list of what is participating in this: 
    -Subject (interface) 
        will maintain a list of its observers 
        Provides a interface for dealing with observers 
    
    -Observer (interface) 
        Will define an interface for update method for objects 
        these need to be notified of changes in the subject 
    
    -SprayRecord Subjuect (this is a concrete subject?) 
        Send a notification to observers when state change 
    
    -AuditLog Observer (concrete observer?)
        Will write to the sudit log database on update 
    
    -Logging Observer (concrete observer?)
        Will write to a log file on update 

Will attempt to do this with a push strategy where the subject will pass info to all observers as an arguement of update()
If we need more help with the observer pattern and python I got most of the info and tutorials needed from 
Refactoring Guru and geeksforgeeks.

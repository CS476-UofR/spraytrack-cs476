"""
This file will contain the model component of the MVC architecture 

Just as a reference in MVC: 
    - The model handles data logic and interacts with the data store
    - The view handles the data display (frontend)
    - The controller will handle any user actions (This is in views.py)

In this file you can also find the product classes for a simple factory design pattern 
    - The user is the base product 
    - OperatorUser is a concrete product 
    - AdminUser is a concrete product 
The UserFactory that is in the factory.py file will use an if/elif structure to decide which concrete product 
to create, kinda like the pizza factory example from our lectures.

The audit log model in this file will act as the observer pattern. The views will not write to the sudit log table directly
I will try to have the observers in observer.py handle that when we send it update notifications from the spray record.

I think it is also important to highlight some quality requirements that are addressed in this file: 
    - Correctness 
        Fields will match the exact data types from the schema
    
    -Robustness
        UserRole and RecordStatus choices prevent invalid data from being saved into the database
